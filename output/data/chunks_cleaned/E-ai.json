    "When you silently rehearse a phone number, you hear a voice that makes no sound. When you plan a route through your city, you see streets that are not before your eyes. When you dread a confrontation, your stomach tightens around an event that has not occurred. These are not metaphors. They are the primary medium of thought itself.",
    "The claim is this: thinking, at its core, consists of internally generated sensations — inner speech, mental imagery, affective feelings, and bodily simulations that recruit the same neural machinery used for perception and action, but driven from the inside rather than the outside. Thought is not some abstract symbolic process floating above the senses. It *is* the senses, turned inward.",
    "The strongest evidence comes from inner speech, the phenomenon most people identify as \"thinking.\" Alderson-Day and Fernyhough (2015) synthesized decades of research showing that inner speech activates left inferior frontal and superior temporal regions — the same areas engaged in overt speech production and perception. Electromyographic studies dating back to Jacobson in the 1930s detected subvocalizations during silent thinking, suggesting that inner speech is not a pale echo of real speech but a motorically grounded simulation of it. Vygotsky (1934/1987) proposed the developmental story: children first think aloud, then internalize speech, so that adult thought literally descends from social conversation turned private. On this view, we think *in* language because thinking grew out of speaking.",
    "Visual imagery tells a parallel story. Kosslyn's (1980, 1994) program of research demonstrated that mental images behave like spatial representations: people take longer to scan across a large mental image, and they can rotate mental objects at measurable angular velocities. Neuroimaging confirms that early visual cortex activates during vivid imagery (Pearson, 2019), and patients with damage to visual areas can lose the capacity to visualize. The philosopher-neuroscientist pair of Bartolomeo and colleagues have shown that imagery and perception share not just neural substrate but organizational structure — retinotopic maps, color processing channels, spatial reference frames.",
    "Beyond speech and vision, there is growing evidence that other sensory modalities participate in thought. Barsalou's (1999, 2008) theory of perceptual symbol systems argues that all concepts are grounded in modal simulations: understanding \"chair\" involves partial reactivation of the visual, motor, and proprioceptive patterns associated with seeing and sitting in chairs. Damasio's (1994) somatic marker hypothesis extends this to reasoning itself — the gut feelings and bodily sensations that accompany decision-making are not noise interfering with rational thought but constitutive components of it. Remove the body's signals, as happens in certain cases of ventromedial prefrontal damage, and reasoning degrades despite intact logical capacity.",
    "What ties these findings together is a principle: the brain does not maintain a separate \"thinking organ\" distinct from its sensory and motor systems. It recycles perceptual and motor resources for internal purposes. This is sometimes called \"neural reuse\" (Anderson, 2010) — evolutionarily older circuits for sensing and acting get repurposed for cognition. Thinking, on this account, is what happens when sensory and motor systems run offline, decoupled from immediate environmental input but still generating the same kinds of representations.",
    "This explains features of thought that a purely symbolic account struggles with. It explains why thinking is *phenomenal* — why there is something it is like to think, just as there is something it is like to see or hear. It explains why thoughts come in different \"modalities\" — verbal thinkers, visual thinkers, people who think in spatial patterns or bodily sensations. It explains why thought is so tightly linked to emotion: if thought is generated sensation, and emotion is generated bodily sensation, then the two are not separate systems but overlapping instances of the same underlying process.",
    "The most serious challenge to the \"thinking is generated sensation\" thesis comes from evidence of thought *without* reportable sensory content. Hurlburt's (2011) Descriptive Experience Sampling studies, which interrupt people at random moments and ask what was in their experience just before the beep, reveal that a significant portion of inner experience consists of what Hurlburt calls \"unsymbolized thinking\" — a sense of thinking about something specific without any accompanying words, images, or other sensory qualities. Participants report knowing what they were thinking but deny any inner speech, imagery, or feeling accompanied it.",
    "This is not a marginal finding. Hurlburt estimates that unsymbolized thinking constitutes roughly a quarter of sampled inner experience across participants. If thought is generated sensation, what do we make of thinking that seems to lack any sensory character?",
    "There are several possible responses. The first is skeptical: perhaps unsymbolized thinking reflects a failure of introspective access rather than an absence of sensory content. Thought may always have sensory qualities, but they may sometimes be too faint, fleeting, or unfamiliar to report. Schwitzgebel (2008) has argued extensively that introspection is unreliable — people are frequently wrong about the character of their own inner experience. The absence of reported sensation is not the same as the absence of sensation.",
    "A second response grants the phenomenon but preserves the thesis: perhaps unsymbolized thinking represents the *preparatory* or *dispositional* aspect of sensory generation — a readiness to produce imagery or speech that has not yet been fully instantiated. On this view, it is the edge of sensation rather than its absence, the way a half-formed word sits on the tip of the tongue without yet becoming audible even internally.",
    "A third response concedes the point partially. Perhaps not all thinking is generated sensation. Perhaps some cognitive processes — particularly rapid, automatic, or highly practiced ones — proceed without sensory instantiation. But the thesis need not be absolute to be important. If the *primary* medium of deliberate, conscious thought is generated sensation, and if stripping away inner speech, imagery, and bodily feeling eliminates most of what we recognize as thinking, then the thesis identifies something fundamental about the architecture of thought even if it does not cover every case.",
    "If thinking is generated sensation, then the question of whether other entities think becomes a question about whether they generate internal sensory states. For animals, this is plausible: rats appear to \"replay\" spatial trajectories during rest (Wilson & McNaughton, 1994), and birds may rehearse songs internally before singing (Dave & Margoliash, 2000). These are generated sensations in the relevant sense — endogenously produced activations of perceptual and motor systems.",
    "For large language models, the picture is different. LLMs produce language but do not generate internal auditory experiences. They have no visual cortex to reactivate, no body to provide somatic markers. If the thesis is correct, then what LLMs do — however sophisticated — is not thinking in the sense that humans and likely many animals think. It is processing without sensation, pattern completion without phenomenology. This does not make it useless, but it makes it categorically different.",
    "The proposal that thoughts are generated sensations is not merely a claim about the incidental packaging of cognition. It is a claim about what thinking fundamentally is: the brain's sensory and motor systems operating in generative mode, producing the sights, sounds, feelings, and bodily states that constitute the stream of consciousness. The strongest objection — the existence of unsymbolized thinking — challenges the universality of the claim but not its core insight. Most of what we call thinking happens in a sensory medium, arises from sensory systems, and would not exist without the capacity to generate experience from the inside. Thought is not above the senses. It is the senses, dreaming while awake."
