    "Thinking and the self have long been at the centre of philosophical and scientific debate, with competing theories trying either to link them tightly or to separate them.",
    "A major difficulty is that \"the self\" is hard to define in a way that everyone accepts. For that reason, in this essay I treat the sense of self not as a fixed entity but as a model: a functional structure that can vary in strength, complexity, and the role it plays in cognition.",
    "Even then, \"self\" can be defined in different ways, so I will work with two distinctions, following Shaun Gallagher's review (2000). First, I use the notion of the minimal self. It is a structural feature of experience: mental states are given as mine, from a first-person point of view, an \"I\" perspective. Crucially, the minimal self can operate without explicit self-reflection. One does not need to think \"this is me\" in order for perception, action, and emotion to be organised as occurring for and from a single perspective.",
    "Second, I focus on narrative identity, a temporally extended self constituted through the stories we and others tell about us (Dennett, 1991). This narrative self links past and future: it includes autobiographical memory, projects, and intentions; it is shaped by social environments and ideologies; and it evolves through time, supporting relatively stable commitments, opinions, and self-descriptions.",
    "Opinions do not emerge in a vacuum, they emerge through thinking. But \"thinking\" is also ambiguous, so I distinguish two forms.",
    "The first is thinking as information processing: operations that transform information from one state to another in ways that support prediction, inference, decision-making, problem-solving, and planning. In this sense, thinking can be understood as lower-order cognition: it draws on sensory inputs, stored states (memory at time t), and internal mappings that allow the system to compute behavioural or representational outputs.",
    "The second is higher-order thinking, which incorporates reasoning in a stronger sense. Plato famously characterises reasoning as an internal dialogue; even if one rejects his metaphysical assumptions, the image remains useful. Higher-order thinking involves a structured \"inner debate\" in which experiences, priors, and interpretations are evaluated, compared, and reorganised into more explicit judgements.",
    "This leads to the central question of the essay: what enables higher-order thinking to occur at all? More precisely, how much self is required for different kinds of thinking? To what extent is a minimal self sufficient, and when, if ever, does a richer narrative identity become necessary?",
    "My working hypothesis is that information-processing thinking requires at least a minimal self, because even basic cognition often depends on an agent-centred organisation of inputs and outputs. By contrast, higher-order thinking typically requires not only a minimal self but also narrative identity, because reasoning across time, drawing on personal history, projecting oneself into the future, and sustaining commitments, depends on some form of extended self-model.",
    "To defend and test this hypothesis, I will examine evidence and arguments from humans and non-human animals, and I will close with a brief open question about large language models (LLMs).",
    "**Human minimal self for information processing, narrative identity for extended higher-order thinking:**\n\nIn humans, both the minimal self and the narrative self seem to be operative, and this duality maps onto the two senses of thinking defined above.",
    "Following Gallagher (2000), the minimal self is the implicit first-person structure of experience: perceptions, intentions, and emotions are given as mine even without explicit self-reflection. Zahavi supports this by arguing that experience has built-in for-me-ness (pre-reflective self-awareness), not something added later by a self-concept. Metzinger frames it differently: the self is a model the brain constructs to organise information and guide action, not a separate entity.",
    "Despite different philosophies, both reinforce the same point: humans can have a minimal self without a narrative identity, and cognition can be self-involving without being story-like.",
    "Why think the minimal self is important for information-processing thinking? A useful way to motivate this is through the functional demands of action and perception. Many cognitive tasks require an agent-centred organisation of signals: the system must coordinate sensory input, memory, and motor output in a way that treats some states as its own and some changes as caused by its own actions.",
    "In predictive control accounts, the brain uses internal models to anticipate the sensory consequences of movement (often described through efference copy and forward modelling). The crucial point is not a technical detail but a cognitive role: the system must differentiate \"changes due to my action\" from \"changes due to the world.\" Without that distinction, perception becomes unreliable and action becomes unstable.",
    "This looks like a minimal self in functional form: it is a basic organisation of cognition around an acting perspective, grounded in ownership and agency rather than autobiography.",
    "Everyday life suggests the same dissociation. In flow states high absorption in a task, explicit self-monitoring and narrative self-evaluation can drop dramatically (\"How do I look? What does this say about me?\") while attention, rapid decision-making, and skilled problem-solving remain strong.",
    "This does not show that the self disappears, but rather that the narrative layer can become quiet while the minimal first-person structure remains active and sufficient for complex information processing. The system still integrates perception and action as happening for one perspective, even if it is not rehearsing a story about who that perspective is.",
    "The narrative self becomes most visible when thinking turns into higher-order reasoning across time. Here the cognitive goal is not simply to compute a good move, but to evaluate reasons and commitments that extend beyond the present moment.",
    "Narrative identity (Dennett, 1991) provides an organising structure for this: it supports self-continuity, stabilises commitments, and integrates social roles and values into deliberation. In practice, much higher-order thinking depends on comparing present impulses with past commitments and projecting current decisions into future consequences. That kind of reasoning is naturally supported by a self-model that extends across time.",
    "Clinical cases help test whether narrative identity is strictly required. Profound amnesia following medial temporal lobe damage, classically illustrated by patient H.M., severely disrupts the ability to form new long-term episodic memories and fragments autobiographical continuity.",
    "Yet such individuals can still reason coherently in the immediate situation: they can understand questions, draw inferences, and make choices in real time. This strongly suggests that narrative identity is not necessary for information processing. A person can lose much of their life story and still have a functioning first-person perspective and the capacity to reason \"in the moment.\"",
    "At the same time, the same literature shows what narrative/episodic resources contribute. Work by Hassabis and colleagues (2007) suggests that hippocampal amnesic patients are impaired not only in recalling the past but also in constructing richly detailed future scenarios.",
    "This matters because a central component of human higher-order thinking is future-directed simulation: planning, imagining outcomes, weighing long-term consequences, and coordinating present actions with a future self. If episodic scaffolding is damaged, reasoning may remain possible, but it becomes harder to sustain a temporally extended deliberation that relies on mental time travel and self-continuity. (what about opinions etc)",
    "Overall, the human evidence supports the essay's hypothesis in a nuanced way. The minimal self appears closely tied to information-processing thinking by providing the perspectival organisation required to bind inputs and outputs to one agent. The narrative self is not a universal prerequisite for all higher-order thinking, but it strongly supports the specifically human form of higher-order reasoning that extends across time, integrates values and commitments, and coordinates present decisions with an anticipated future.",
    "**Animals: identity without narrative, minimal self through agency, and graded higher-order thinking**\n\nNon-human animals are especially useful for this topic because they allow us to separate identity (stable individual differences) from the minimal self (basic agency and a self–world distinction) without immediately importing human assumptions. In humans, \"identity\" is often treated as inherently narrative (\"who I am\" as the story I tell). In animals, we can investigate individuality and agency without presupposing autobiography.",
    "On the identity side, many studies show that animals display stable, measurable individual differences in behaviour, often described as temperaments or personalities. In mice, for example, high-throughput behavioural tracking across many sessions can extract consistent behavioural \"signatures\" that distinguish individuals: some animals reliably explore more, take more risks, or show stronger avoidance patterns.",
    "In that sense, one can partially \"decode\" a mouse's individuality from its behavioural profile. This supports the idea that animals can possess identity-like consistency without anything like a human narrative identity. They have stable traits, but not necessarily a story-like self that they can recount, revise, and project.",
    "Developmental history reinforces this point. Early-life stress paradigms (an analogue to \"childhood anxiety\") show that early experiences can produce long-lasting changes in anxiety-like responses and social functioning. For instance, manipulations such as maternal separation can lead to enduring shifts in social interaction, threat sensitivity, and coping style later in life.",
    "Functionally, that means an animal's past can shape its later behavioural profile in a stable way: \"who this animal is\" becomes partly a product of its history. Yet this continuity can be implemented as durable changes in affective regulation, learning, and stress responsivity rather than as an autobiographical narrative. Identity here is trait-like and developmental, not story-like.",
    "The minimal self in animals is most plausibly grounded in sensorimotor mechanisms that support a self–world distinction. A central candidate is corollary discharge (efference copy), found across many species. When an animal moves, its sensory input changes; the system needs a way to distinguish self-generated sensory changes from externally caused events.",
    "Corollary discharge provides such a mechanism by labelling or predicting the sensory consequences of self-produced actions, thereby stabilising perception and supporting controlled behaviour. This is precisely the kind of structure that aligns with the minimal self as a model: it is not narrative identity, but it is a functional organisation around agency (\"this change is due to me\") and ownership (\"this signal belongs to my action\").",
    "On this basis, the claim that information-processing thinking requires at least a minimal self becomes highly plausible for animals: flexible decision-making and control depend on treating some information as linked to the agent's own outputs.",
    "The harder question is whether animals show higher-order thinking. Here Nagel's \"bat\" argument is an important philosophical warning: we cannot straightforwardly infer what it is like for another species to have its perspective, because its sensory and action world may differ radically from ours. Even if we avoid the word \"conscious,\" Nagel's point still applies: subjective perspective is not directly accessible from the outside, and interpretation is always risky.",
    "Still, we can ask whether animals show functional markers often associated with higher-order cognition, such as monitoring uncertainty, representing events across time, or flexibly adapting behaviour in ways that go beyond immediate stimulus control.",
    "Some studies suggest metacognition-like behaviour in animals: for instance, rats can be trained to opt out of difficult trials, and their use of such \"uncertainty responses\" sometimes tracks task difficulty in a way interpreted as sensitivity to their own likelihood of being correct. Whether this reflects genuine self-monitoring or sophisticated learned cues is debated, but either way it points to a level of cognitive control beyond simple reflexes.",
    "Another line concerns episodic-like memory. Scrub jays have been shown to remember what they cached, where they cached it, and when they cached it, and to adjust retrieval depending on perishability, behaviour that suggests event-based memory used for future-oriented action.",
    "If such findings generalise, they indicate that at least some animals possess partial episodic scaffolding that can support higher-order thinking in a limited form: not a fully narrative identity, but a capacity to organise behaviour using representations that extend across time.",
    "The animal case therefore supports a graded version of the essay's hypothesis. A minimal self as agency and self world distinction plausibly underwrites information-processing thinking widely across species. Narrative identity in the rich human sense is likely absent or limited in most animals, but some species may show partial event-based or future-oriented resources that support limited higher-order thinking. The main lesson is that self-models can be layered and graded rather than all-or-nothing.",
    "**A brief open question: LLMs and \"higher-order\" outputs without lived selfhood**\n\nLLMs complicate the picture because they can generate outputs that look like higher-order thinking: they produce arguments, counterarguments, and plans, and they can simulate an \"inner debate\" in language.",
    "Yet they lack two features that anchored the earlier analysis: an embodied sensorimotor loop (and thus the biological mechanisms typically associated with agency and ownership), and an autobiographical history that generates a lived narrative identity with stakes and continuity. Their \"I\" is usually a linguistic role rather than a developmentally grounded identity.",
    "This leaves an open question rather than a conclusion. Either (1) some forms of higher-order thinking, at least in linguistic form, can be implemented without the same kind of minimal and narrative self found in animals and humans, or (2) LLMs are best understood as producing reason-like text without the underlying architecture that makes higher-order thinking what it is in biological agents.",
    "On either reading, LLMs sharpen the need to specify what counts as higher-order thinking in the first place: is it the ability to generate structured reasons in language, or is it reasoning embedded in an agent that owns actions, projects itself into the future, and sustains commitments?",
    "**Conclusion**\n\nBy treating the sense of self as a model with layers, this essay argued for a structured relationship between self and thinking. The minimal self's ownership and agency organised from a first-person perspective appears closely tied to information-processing thinking by providing an agent-centred structure that binds inputs and outputs.",
    "The narrative self as a temporally extended identity shaped by memory, social context, and future-directed intention, strongly supports the distinctively human form of higher-order thinking that extends across time, enabling long-horizon planning, self-continuity, and commitment-sensitive deliberation.",
    "Animal research suggests that identity and higher-order capacities come in degrees, with stable individuality often present even where narrative selfhood is minimal.",
    "Finally, LLMs present an open problem: they can imitate higher-order reasoning in language while challenging the assumption that such reasoning always requires the same kind of self-model as biological agents."
