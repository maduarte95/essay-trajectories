    "Thinking is not a single thing. It is a composite process, built from substrates that span spatial scales—from the molecular dynamics of individual synapses to the collective intelligence of entire populations. Just as the human body is organized into nested hierarchies of cells, tissues, organs, and systems, cognition is organized into nested hierarchies of neural events, cognitive operations, representational frameworks, and social practices.",
    "This essay argues that thinking is best understood as a multiscalar phenomenon: it is *composed* of distinct levels of organization, each with its own dynamics, and it *develops* through time as these levels interact, reorganize, and build upon one another.",
    "Grasping this architecture is essential for understanding not only how human thought works but how it compares to cognition in animals and machines.",
    "At the lowest level, thinking depends on biophysical events. Individual neurons communicate through electrochemical signaling—action potentials that propagate along axons and trigger neurotransmitter release at synapses. The timing, frequency, and pattern of these signals carry information.",
    "Mainen and Sejnowski (1995) demonstrated that individual cortical neurons can fire with millisecond-level temporal precision when driven by fluctuating inputs, establishing that even at the cellular scale, the nervous system encodes information with remarkable fidelity.",
    "This precision at the level of single cells is a foundational substrate: without reliable neural signaling, higher-order cognitive operations could not be constructed.",
    "But single neurons do not think. Thinking emerges from the coordinated activity of neural populations. Ensembles of neurons form circuits that implement specific computations—detecting edges in a visual scene, maintaining information in working memory, computing the expected value of a reward. These circuits are organized into larger systems: the hippocampal system supports episodic memory, prefrontal cortex supports executive control, and the basal ganglia mediate action selection. Each of these systems operates with its own characteristic dynamics and timescales.",
    "Buzsáki (2006), in *Rhythms of the Brain*, argued that the brain's oscillatory activity—theta rhythms, gamma oscillations, slow cortical waves—provides a temporal scaffolding that coordinates information flow across these distributed systems.",
    "Thinking, on this view, is not localized in any single region but arises from the dynamic interaction of multiple neural systems operating at multiple timescales.",
    "Moving further up the hierarchy, cognitive science has long recognized that thought involves structured representations and operations over those representations.",
    "Fodor (1975), in *The Language of Thought*, proposed that cognition operates on symbol-like mental representations with compositional structure—thoughts are built from parts, much as sentences are built from words.",
    "While the strong version of this \"language of thought\" hypothesis remains contested, the core insight stands: complex thoughts are composed of simpler components combined according to rules.",
    "When you reason that \"if it rains, the match will be cancelled, and if the match is cancelled, I will stay home,\" you are chaining together representational units in a structured, hierarchical fashion. This compositional structure is itself a level of cognitive organization, distinct from the neural circuits that implement it.",
    "Finally, thinking extends beyond the individual brain.",
    "Clark and Chalmers (1998), in their influential paper \"The Extended Mind,\" argued that cognitive processes routinely incorporate external structures—notebooks, diagrams, calculators, and other people. On this view, the boundaries of cognition do not stop at the skull.",
    "A scientist reasoning with a mathematical model, a group of engineers brainstorming at a whiteboard, or a culture transmitting knowledge through written language are all instances of thinking that is distributed across brains, bodies, and environments.",
    "Hutchins (1995), in *Cognition in the Wild*, documented how navigation aboard a naval vessel is a cognitive process distributed across multiple individuals and instruments—no single crew member \"thinks\" the ship's position, but the system as a whole computes it.",
    "Population-level intelligence, then, is not merely a metaphor. It is a genuine level of cognitive organization, with its own dynamics and capacities that exceed those of any individual.",
    "This multiscalar architecture is not static. It develops—both across evolutionary time and across the lifespan of an individual organism.",
    "The developmental trajectory of thinking reveals how the different levels of cognitive organization come online, interact, and transform one another.",
    "A human infant begins life with severely constrained cognitive capacities.",
    "Neonates possess core systems for representing objects, numbers, agents, and spatial relationships (Spelke & Kinzler, 2007), but these systems are limited in scope and flexibility.",
    "An infant can track a small number of objects and distinguish between numerosities, but cannot reason abstractly, plan multi-step actions, or reflect on its own thought processes.",
    "The substrates are present—billions of neurons, intact sensory systems—but the higher-order organization that supports mature thinking has not yet been assembled.",
    "What changes over development is not merely the accumulation of knowledge but the reorganization of cognitive architecture.",
    "Piaget (1952) described cognitive development as a sequence of qualitative stage transitions: from sensorimotor intelligence, in which the infant thinks through bodily action, to preoperational thought, concrete operations, and finally formal operations, in which the adolescent can reason about abstract and hypothetical possibilities.",
    "While the strict stage model has been revised by subsequent research, the fundamental insight remains powerful: development involves not just learning more but learning to think differently.",
    "The components of thought are restructured, combined in new ways, and subordinated to higher-order control processes.",
    "Neural plasticity is the biological engine of this reorganization.",
    "The developing brain undergoes massive synaptic overproduction followed by experience-dependent pruning (Huttenlocher, 2002). Connections that are frequently activated are strengthened; those that are not are eliminated. This process sculpts neural circuits to reflect the statistical structure of the organism's environment.",
    "Critically, different brain systems mature at different rates. Sensory and motor cortices mature relatively early, while prefrontal cortex—the seat of executive function, planning, and cognitive control—continues to develop into the mid-twenties (Casey, Tottenham, Liston, & Durston, 2005).",
    "This protracted development of prefrontal systems explains why the highest levels of the cognitive hierarchy—metacognition, abstract reasoning, impulse regulation—are the last to come online.",
    "Learning itself is not a unitary process but a hierarchy of processes.",
    "At the lowest level, synaptic plasticity mechanisms such as long-term potentiation adjust connection strengths based on experience. At higher levels, the learner acquires strategies, schemas, and metacognitive skills that govern how lower-level learning proceeds.",
    "Harlow (1949) demonstrated this principle with the concept of \"learning sets\": monkeys trained on many discrimination problems did not just learn each individual problem but learned *how to learn*, acquiring a generalized strategy that transferred to novel problems.",
    "This is learning at a higher level of the hierarchy—learning that restructures the process of learning itself.",
    "Development does not end in adolescence. Across the full lifespan, cognitive systems continue to change.",
    "Crystallized intelligence—accumulated knowledge and expertise—tends to increase well into middle age, even as fluid intelligence, the capacity for novel problem-solving, begins to decline (Cattell, 1963).",
    "In older adulthood, compensatory strategies emerge: experienced thinkers rely more heavily on external supports, social networks, and practiced routines to maintain cognitive performance.",
    "The architecture of thinking shifts again, redistributing the load across different substrates.",
    "This framework illuminates cognition beyond the human case.",
    "Animal cognition, too, is multiscalar: honeybee colonies make collective decisions about nest sites through distributed processes that no individual bee controls (Seeley, 2010). Octopuses distribute neural processing across semi-autonomous arms. And artificial intelligence systems like large language models exhibit a different compositional structure entirely—billions of parameters organized into layers, trained on statistical patterns in text, capable of generating coherent language without anything resembling biological neurons or developmental trajectories.",
    "The comparison is instructive. Biological thinking is characterized by hierarchical composition, developmental transformation, and plasticity. Machine thinking, at least in its current form, is characterized by fixed architecture and parameter adjustment during training, with little of the qualitative reorganization that defines biological development.",
    "Whether machines could develop genuine multiscalar cognitive architectures—systems that restructure themselves across levels of organization—remains an open and consequential question.",
    "Thinking is not a monolithic capacity that an organism either possesses or lacks. It is a composite, hierarchical process built from substrates that range from molecular events to cultural practices. It develops through time—not merely by accumulating content but by reorganizing its own architecture.",
    "Understanding thought requires attending to all of these levels simultaneously and to the developmental dynamics that bind them together.",
    "The infant, the adult expert, the aging strategist, the bee swarm, and the neural network are all thinking—but the composition of their thinking, the substrates from which it is built, differ profoundly.",
    "A science of cognition adequate to its subject must be, like cognition itself, multiscalar."
