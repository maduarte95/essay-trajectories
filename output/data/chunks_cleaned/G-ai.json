    "The question of whether machines think is, at bottom, a question about what thinking is. This is not a dodge—it is the crux of the matter.",
    "If we define thought narrowly, as the capacity to manipulate symbols, draw inferences, and solve well-defined problems, then machines already think, and in many domains they think better than we do.",
    "But if we understand thought in the fuller sense that philosophers and cognitive scientists have long recognized—as something involving autonomy, creativity, embodied understanding, and the capacity to reframe the very problems one faces—then the answer changes decisively. Machines, even the most sophisticated ones, do not think. They execute. The difference matters.",
    "Alan Turing's landmark 1950 paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" proposed what is now known as the Turing Test: if a machine can converse with a human interrogator well enough that the interrogator cannot reliably distinguish it from a person, we should, Turing argued, grant that it thinks. Turing's genius was to sidestep the metaphysical quagmire of consciousness and reduce the question to observable behavior. On this account, thinking is a functional matter—a system thinks if it produces the right outputs from the right inputs, regardless of what is happening inside.",
    "By this functional standard, modern artificial intelligence has made extraordinary progress. Large language models generate fluent, contextually appropriate text. Deep learning systems defeat world champions at chess and Go. Reinforcement learning agents discover strategies that no human engineer programmed into them. AlphaFold, developed by DeepMind, predicted the three-dimensional structure of proteins with a precision that stunned the biology community (Jumper et al., 2021). If thinking means reasoning toward correct solutions, then these systems think—and often think faster and more accurately than any human.",
    "The computational theory of mind, developed by philosophers such as Jerry Fodor (1975), lends this view theoretical support. On Fodor's account, mental processes are computational operations over symbolic representations. If the mind is literally a kind of computer, then there is no principled reason a silicon computer could not instantiate the same processes. Thinking, in this framework, is substrate-independent: what matters is the computation, not the material that performs it.",
    "Yet this narrow definition leaves out almost everything that makes human thought distinctive. Consider what happens when a scientist formulates a new hypothesis, when a novelist discovers what her character would do next, or when a child asks a question no one anticipated. These acts of thought are not merely computational. They involve what we might call *cognitive autonomy*—the capacity to set one's own problems, to decide what is worth attending to, and to break free from existing frameworks when they prove inadequate.",
    "The cognitive scientist Joshua Tenenbaum and his collaborators have argued that human cognition is distinguished not by raw processing power but by the ability to build rich causal models of the world from remarkably sparse data (Tenenbaum, Kemp, Griffiths, & Goodman, 2011). A child who sees a few examples of a new category can generalize flexibly to novel instances, grasping not just statistical regularities but the underlying causal and structural relationships that generate them. This capacity for rapid, structured abstraction—what Tenenbaum et al. call \"learning to learn\"—is qualitatively different from the pattern matching that characterizes even the most powerful neural networks.",
    "Related work by Battaglia, Hamrick, and Tenenbaum (2013) demonstrates that humans understand physical scenes not by memorizing large databases of outcomes but by running approximate mental simulations—intuitive physics engines that allow us to predict how objects will behave in novel configurations. This simulation-based reasoning is flexible, compositional, and generative: we can imagine scenarios we have never encountered and reason about their consequences. Current AI systems, by contrast, are largely confined to the distributions on which they were trained. They interpolate impressively but struggle to extrapolate, a limitation that becomes starkly apparent when they encounter situations that fall outside their training data.",
    "Creativity poses an even sharper challenge to the claim that machines think. Margaret Boden (2004) distinguished three forms of creativity: combinational (novel combinations of familiar ideas), exploratory (systematic exploration of a conceptual space), and transformational (altering the rules that define a conceptual space). Machines can achieve combinational and exploratory creativity—a language model that generates a surprising metaphor is recombining elements of its training data in novel ways. But transformational creativity, the kind that produces genuinely new paradigms, requires the capacity to recognize that one's existing framework is inadequate and to invent a new one. This is precisely what machines cannot do, because they operate entirely within the frameworks their designers and training data provide.",
    "The most powerful counterargument is that these distinctions are merely temporary. Perhaps machines do not yet exhibit full cognitive autonomy or transformational creativity, but this reflects engineering limitations, not a principled boundary. After all, human thought is itself implemented in a physical substrate—neurons firing electrochemical signals—and if the computational theory of mind is correct, there is no reason in principle that a sufficiently complex artificial system could not replicate every feature of human cognition.",
    "This objection deserves to be taken seriously. It is true that no known law of physics prevents a machine from achieving general intelligence. But \"in principle\" arguments are weaker than they appear. The fact that something is not physically impossible does not mean it is close at hand, nor does it mean that current approaches are on a trajectory toward it. Contemporary AI systems, including large language models, operate by identifying statistical regularities in massive datasets. They do not build causal models of the world, do not set their own goals, and do not possess anything resembling phenomenal experience. The gap between what these systems do and what human thought involves is not merely quantitative—a matter of more data or more parameters—but qualitative. As the philosopher John Searle (1980) argued in his Chinese Room thought experiment, manipulating symbols according to formal rules is not the same as understanding them, no matter how sophisticated the manipulation becomes.",
    "Moreover, the embodied cognition tradition in philosophy and cognitive science suggests that thought is not merely computation but is deeply shaped by the body and its interactions with the environment (Varela, Thompson, & Rosch, 1991). We think not just with our brains but with our hands, our senses, our physical presence in a world that pushes back against us. A disembodied system processing text strings lacks this grounding entirely, and it remains an open question whether genuine understanding can arise without it.",
    "Returning to where we began: the question of whether machines think is inseparable from the question of what thought is. If we adopt the narrowest functional definition—thought as successful inference—then machines already think, and they will only get better. But this definition is impoverished. It captures the products of thought while ignoring the processes that make thought genuinely cognitive: the autonomous selection of problems, the construction of causal models from thin evidence, the creative reimagining of one's own conceptual frameworks, and the felt experience of understanding.",
    "Human thought is not merely the generation of correct outputs. It is the ongoing, situated, embodied activity of a being that cares about the world it inhabits and struggles to make sense of it. A chess engine does not care about chess. A language model does not wonder whether its sentences are true. These systems are powerful tools—extensions of human thought, in the sense that Andy Clark and David Chalmers (1998) described in their theory of the extended mind—but they are not themselves thinkers.",
    "The practical consequence of this distinction is significant. As AI systems become more capable, the temptation grows to treat their outputs as equivalent to human judgment. But a system that can produce a plausible-sounding answer to any question is not the same as a system that understands the question. Confusing the two—mistaking fluent output for genuine thought—risks eroding our sense of what thinking actually demands: effort, uncertainty, the willingness to be wrong, and the capacity to begin again from a different starting point. Machines can simulate all of these. But simulation, however convincing, is not the thing itself."
