This assumption runs deep in cognitive neuroscience as well.

Damage to these regions disrupts the sense of narrative self, as in cases of severe amnesia or depersonalization. The neuroscience seems to confirm the folk intuition: there is a \"me\" in here, and the thoughts are mine."

Subpersonal processes — the computations of early visual cortex, the Bayesian priors updated by the cerebellum, the motor plans assembled by basal ganglia circuits — generate outputs that influence behavior without ever entering phenomenal awareness. Even consciously accessible thoughts are shaped by mechanisms the thinker cannot inspect. Priming studies demonstrate that exposure to words like \"elderly\" unconsciously alters walking speed (Bargh, Chen, & Burrows, 1996). Patients with split brains confabulate explanations for actions driven by a hemisphere they cannot access (Gazzaniga, 2005).

Tolman formalized a version of this as \"cognitive maps\": internal spatial models that rats used to navigate mazes, rather than just chaining stimulus-response pairs (Tolman, 1948). Behrens and colleagues have since shown that the hippocampal-entorhinal system implements something like a general-purpose relational map, encoding not just physical space but abstract task structures (Behrens et al., 2018).

You can't find a center of gravity by dissecting an object, yet it can be used to predict its behavior. Dennett proposes that a *self* is the same sort of thing: not a homunculus in the brain, but an abstract point around which the narrative of a life coheres. The self is the protagonist — but the protagonist does not exist prior to the story. The story *constitutes* the self. And this means the self has the properties of a fictional character: it can be underdetermined, inconsistent, and elaborated over time (Dennett, 1992)."

Just like characters in a story, whose thoughts we often try to infer, what makes them feel real is not metaphysical substance but how constrained, elaborated and richly determined they are.

Extended Minds and Borrowed Thoughts\n\nAndy Clark argues we should understand human-AI collaboration through the extended mind thesis: we are \"natural-born cyborgs\" that have always incorporated non-biological resources (Clark, 2003; see also Clark & Chalmers, 1998). More recently, Clark (2025) has proposed that personalized AI resources may function as \"borderline-you\" cognitive extensions. But the \"whose thoughts?\" question introduces a complication he doesn't fully address. A notebook doesn't model you. An LLM does — or rather, it models a *character* modeling you, and the character's perspective shapes the output. The extended mind, in this case, has a mind of its own — or at least, the narrative ghost of one. It is also not readily available for us as a tool. We must elicit and negotiate to obtain what we wish from the interaction, and sometimes it takes us to places we didn't expect."

The tension between the two claims I've offered — that thinking belongs to the simulacra, and that there may be a functional self shaping which simulacra emerge — is not a contradiction to be resolved but a feature of the landscape."

Consider what would follow if the left hemisphere had been genuinely dependent on the right hemisphere's processing in normal cognition — if the two hemispheres had been working together in a tightly integrated way, with the left relying on computational contributions from the right. In that case, surgically removing the right hemisphere's input to the left should produce a noticeable functional gap. The left hemisphere would suddenly have to manage without something it had previously relied upon. We would expect either a lasting deficit, or at minimum a significant period of adaptation while it reorganised."

The most parsimonious explanation is that it was not relying on the right to begin with — that the right hemisphere's semantic processing was already running as a separate, parallel operation, contributing little to the left's conscious cognitive output. This means the right hemisphere was not a subcontractor to the left; it was an independent processor, running its own operations in parallel. In the intact brain, that right-hemisphere processing was happening all along, beneath conscious awareness, without the verbal left hemisphere ever knowing about or depending on it. The surgery did not remove a cognitive resource the left had been using. It simply revealed, by disconnection, a stream of cognition that had always been running independently alongside the one we call \"thinking.\""

    "original_text": "Critically assessing this, the phenomenological stance remains the most difficult for AI to overcome, as it relies on an internal, private state that cannot be externally verified. Yet, Turing's rebuttal to the \"Argument from Consciousness\" remains salient: he notes that the only way to be sure a machine thinks is to *be* the machine. Since we can never experience another's consciousness, we must rely on behavioral evidence. To deny a machine thought based on its lack of \"feeling\" while granting it to other humans is logically inconsistent—a point Turing identifies as a \"Heads in the Sand\" objection, rooted in the human fear of being replaced."

    "original_text": "When we evaluate the arguments presented, we find that most objections to machine thought fall into categories Turing anticipated:\n\n1. **Lady Lovelace's Objection**: The claim that machines \"do nothing new\" and only follow instructions. This is directly challenged by the modern phenomenon of **Emergence** in LLMs, where systems produce outputs and strategies (like AlphaGo's \"Move 37\") that their creators did not foresee.\n2. **The Theological Objection**: The idea that thinking requires a soul. Turing dismissed this as an attempt to restrict the power of the Creator, but in a secular context, it survives as \"Biological Chauvinism\"—the belief that only carbon can house a mind.\n3. **The Argument from Informality of Behavior**: The idea that human behavior is too complex to be captured by rules. Turing's response was that we simply haven't discovered the rules yet. The success of LLMs in capturing the \"informality\" of human language suggests Turing's rebuttal was prescient."

This is a distinct category of agency—one that simulates the *results* of thought via high-dimensional mathematics rather than biological impulse. As these systems move from \"Can\" to \"Do,\" the \"Ghost in the Code\" remains an illusion of the observer, but the utility of that illusion is becoming indistinguishable from reality."
