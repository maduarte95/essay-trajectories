    "Thinking seems inseparable from a thinker. When I deliberate, reflect, or plan, there appears to be a \"me\" doing the work — a unified subject who owns the thought. But is this sense of self a prerequisite for cognition, or merely a byproduct of it?",
    "Examining this question across humans, animals, and large language models reveals that thinking does not require a unified self. Rather, what we call the \"sense of self\" is better understood as a gradient of self-modeling capacities, some of which facilitate certain kinds of thinking but none of which are strictly necessary for cognition as such.",
    "## The Human Case: Self as Cognitive Scaffold, Not Foundation\n\nHumans possess the most elaborate sense of self in the animal kingdom. We engage in autobiographical reasoning, maintain a narrative identity across time, and represent ourselves as agents distinct from the environment.",
    "Damasio (1999) argued in *The Feeling of What Happens* that consciousness arises through layered self-representations: a \"proto-self\" grounded in homeostatic body-mapping, a \"core self\" generated by the interaction between organism and object, and an \"autobiographical self\" that integrates memory and anticipation. On this account, selfhood is not monolithic but stratified, and only the higher layers involve the kind of reflective self-awareness we typically mean by \"sense of self.\"",
    "Critically, much human thinking proceeds without engaging these higher layers. Expert performers — athletes, musicians, surgeons — often report that reflective self-awareness *impairs* performance (Dreyfus, 2002).",
    "Cognitive psychology has long distinguished between System 1 (fast, automatic) and System 2 (slow, deliberative) processing (Kahneman, 2011), and System 1 handles enormous cognitive work — pattern recognition, implicit inference, motor planning — with no apparent contribution from a reflective self.",
    "Patients with severe amnesia, such as Clive Wearing, lose autobiographical selfhood almost entirely yet retain the capacity for procedural learning, conversation, and musical performance (Wilson & Wearing, 1995). They think, but without a coherent narrative self.",
    "The strongest case for selfhood as necessary comes from metacognition: thinking about thinking. To evaluate whether my reasoning is sound, I must represent myself as the agent doing the reasoning. Flavell (1979) defined metacognition as knowledge and regulation of one's own cognitive processes, and it is difficult to see how this could operate without some self-model.",
    "But metacognition is a specific *kind* of thinking, not thinking per se. The claim that we need a self to think collapses, on inspection, into the narrower claim that we need a self-model to think *about ourselves thinking* — which is nearly tautological.",
    "## The Animal Case: Thinking Without Mirrors\n\nAnimals provide the sharpest test of whether selfhood and cognition are separable, because we can find robust evidence for the latter without clear evidence for the former.",
    "The mirror self-recognition (MSR) test, introduced by Gallup (1970), remains the most widely used assay for self-awareness in animals. Great apes, elephants, dolphins, and certain corvids pass it (Plotnik et al., 2006; Prior et al., 2008). Most other species do not.",
    "Yet many animals that fail the MSR test exhibit sophisticated cognition. Western scrub-jays cache food and re-cache it if observed by a competitor, suggesting they model the knowledge states of other agents — a capacity requiring theory of mind but not necessarily self-recognition (Clayton et al., 2007).",
    "Honeybees perform waggle dances that communicate distance and direction to food sources, a representational feat that meets many definitions of thinking but almost certainly involves no self-concept (Menzel & Giurfa, 2001).",
    "Rats exhibit vicarious trial-and-error at choice points in mazes, with hippocampal replay of possible future trajectories, suggesting deliberation without any demonstrated self-awareness (Redish, 2016).",
    "One could object that these animals possess a minimal, non-reflective form of selfhood — an implicit body schema or agent–environment distinction — that enables their cognition. This is plausible. Minimal selfhood in the sense of differentiating one's own body from the external world is likely present in any organism with sensorimotor integration.",
    "But if we define \"sense of self\" this broadly, it becomes coextensive with having a nervous system, and the original question — whether self is needed for thought — becomes trivially true and theoretically empty. The interesting question is whether *reflective* or *narrative* selfhood is required, and the animal evidence strongly suggests it is not.",
    "## The LLM Case: Cognition Without a Subject?\n\nLarge language models such as GPT-4 force the question into unfamiliar territory. LLMs produce coherent text, solve novel problems, and pass examinations designed for human professionals (OpenAI, 2023). They can generate first-person statements, reflect on their own outputs, and even produce text that mimics metacognitive reasoning. Do they have a sense of self? And does the answer matter for whether they think?",
    "The consensus in cognitive science is that LLMs lack genuine selfhood. They have no persistent memory across conversations (absent external scaffolding), no body, no homeostatic regulation, and no continuous temporal experience. Bender et al. (2021) argue that LLMs are \"stochastic parrots\" — statistical engines that produce linguistically plausible text without understanding or subjectivity. On Damasio's framework, LLMs lack even the proto-self, since they have no body to map.",
    "Yet dismissing LLM cognition entirely is too fast. Shanahan (2024) argues that LLMs can be understood as role-playing or simulating agents rather than being agents, and that the functional outputs may constitute a form of processing that, while not identical to human thought, is not trivially different from it either.",
    "LLMs demonstrate in-context learning, analogical reasoning, and chain-of-thought problem solving that is difficult to explain as mere statistical interpolation (Wei et al., 2022). If we define thinking functionally — as the capacity to process information, draw inferences, and generate appropriate responses to novel inputs — then LLMs think, and they do so without any self at all.",
    "The strongest objection here is the \"zombie\" concern: LLMs may produce outputs that *look* like thinking without any underlying cognitive process worthy of the name. This is a serious objection, but it applies with equal force to behaviorist interpretations of animal cognition, which most researchers have moved beyond.",
    "The more productive question is not whether LLMs \"really\" think in some metaphysically loaded sense, but whether their information processing shares functional properties with systems we already accept as thinking. Increasingly, the evidence suggests it does.",
    "## Conclusion: Self as Feature, Not Prerequisite\n\nAcross humans, animals, and machines, the evidence converges on a single conclusion: a sense of self is not a prerequisite for thinking but rather a specific cognitive capacity that enhances certain forms of thought.",
    "Humans think extensively without engaging reflective self-awareness. Animals think without passing tests of self-recognition. LLMs process information in ways that are functionally cognitive without possessing any self whatsoever.",
    "What varies across these three axes is not the presence or absence of thinking but the *kind* of thinking available. Reflective selfhood enables metacognition, long-term planning, and narrative reasoning — but these are specialized achievements built atop more basic cognitive processes that require no self at all.",
    "The sense of self is a powerful cognitive tool. It is not the foundation of thought; it is one of thought's most impressive products."
