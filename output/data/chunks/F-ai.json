    "If thinking requires nothing more than the silent processing of information, then even a thermostat thinks. But no one seriously argues that a thermostat has a mind. What makes the question of animal thought genuinely difficult is that many nonhuman animals do something thermostats cannot: they worry. They anticipate threats that have not yet materialized, hesitate at the edge of open spaces, and avoid contexts associated with prior harm. They exhibit, by every functional and neurochemical measure available, anxiety.",
    "This essay argues that anxiety in nonhuman animals constitutes strong evidence for thought, because anxiety is not a reflexive response to present stimuli but a cognitive process that requires internal representation, temporal projection, and evaluative appraisal—capacities that, taken together, amount to thinking.",
    "A crucial distinction in affective neuroscience separates fear from anxiety. Fear is a response to an immediate, identifiable threat; anxiety is a sustained state of apprehension directed at uncertain or future danger (Davis et al., 2010). This distinction matters because fear can, in principle, be explained by simple stimulus-response mechanisms. A mouse freezes when it sees a cat. That could be a hardwired reflex. But anxiety — the state in which an animal behaves cautiously in an environment where a predator *might* appear, based on prior experience — requires something more. It requires that the animal hold a representation of a possible future event and modulate its behavior accordingly.",
    "The neurobiology supports this distinction. Rodent studies using the elevated plus maze, a standard anxiety assay, show that anxious behavior depends on circuits involving the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and basolateral amygdala (Adhikari et al., 2010). These are not brainstem reflex arcs. The hippocampus is centrally involved in contextual memory and spatial representation; the prefrontal cortex supports flexible, goal-directed behavior. When a rat avoids the open arms of an elevated maze despite no predator being present, it is deploying memory-based representations of risk to guide behavior in an uncertain environment. That is a form of thought by any reasonable functional definition.",
    "One of the most compelling lines of evidence comes from psychopharmacology. The drugs that alleviate anxiety in humans — benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, buspirone — produce analogous behavioral effects in nonhuman animals. Benzodiazepines increase exploration of open arms in the elevated plus maze in rats (Pellow et al., 1985). SSRIs reduce behavioral markers of anxiety in rodents subjected to chronic stress paradigms (Dulawa et al., 2004). These shared pharmacological responses are not coincidental. They reflect conserved neurochemical systems — particularly GABAergic and serotonergic signaling — that modulate affective states across mammals.",
    "If the subjective experience behind these neurochemical systems were fundamentally different in kind between humans and other animals — if rodent \"anxiety\" were merely mechanical responding while human anxiety involved genuine cognition — we would need to explain why the same molecules, acting on the same receptor systems, in homologous brain regions, produce behaviorally parallel effects. The more parsimonious explanation is that these shared systems support genuinely analogous cognitive-affective states. The serotonin system, in particular, has been implicated not just in mood regulation but in behavioral flexibility, prediction, and the processing of uncertainty (Dayan & Huys, 2009) — functions that are intrinsically cognitive.",
    "The relationship between emotion and cognition is not one of opposition but of deep entanglement. Appraisal theories of emotion, developed by Lazarus (1991) and elaborated by Scherer (2001), hold that emotions arise from an organism's evaluation of events in relation to its goals and well-being. On this account, an emotion is not raw sensation; it is the product of a cognitive process that assesses relevance, novelty, and coping potential.",
    "Anxiety, specifically, involves an appraisal of uncertain threat — the organism evaluates that something bad *could* happen and that its capacity to cope is uncertain. This kind of appraisal presupposes internal models of the environment, expectations about probable outcomes, and some representation of the self as a vulnerable agent. When a dog exhibits separation anxiety — pacing, vocalizing, destroying objects when its owner leaves — it is not responding to a present threat but to the *absence* of an expected source of safety and the *anticipation* of continued absence (Overall, 2000). This requires, at minimum, a model of the world that includes expectations about the presence of other agents and a capacity to detect and respond to violations of those expectations.",
    "These capacities map closely onto what cognitive scientists mean by thinking. Thought, broadly construed, is the manipulation of internal representations to guide behavior beyond what is dictated by immediate sensory input (Gallistel, 1990). An animal that adjusts its behavior based on anticipated future states, absent current stimulation, is engaged in just this kind of representational process.",
    "The most serious challenge to this argument comes from Morgan's Canon, the principle that animal behavior should not be attributed to higher psychological processes if it can be explained by lower ones (Morgan, 1894). On this view, what looks like anxiety-driven thought might be nothing more than conditioned avoidance — associative learning without genuine cognitive content. A rat that avoids the open arms of a maze may have simply learned, through reinforcement, that open spaces are associated with aversive outcomes. No representation of future threat is needed; stimulus-response associations suffice.",
    "This objection has force, but it ultimately fails for two reasons. First, the neurobiological evidence shows that anxiety-related behavior is not mediated by simple conditioning circuits. Lesions of the dorsal hippocampus, which is essential for contextual and spatial representation but not for simple cue-based conditioning, selectively reduce anxiety behavior while leaving conditioned fear responses intact (Bannerman et al., 2004). This double dissociation demonstrates that anxiety depends on representational systems that go beyond associative learning.",
    "Second, strict adherence to Morgan's Canon leads to an untenable asymmetry. We do not explain human anxiety as mere conditioned avoidance; we recognize it as involving anticipatory cognition, uncertainty processing, and self-relevant appraisal. Given that the neural substrates, pharmacological sensitivities, and behavioral signatures are conserved across mammalian species, denying analogous cognitive processes in other animals requires a principled reason for treating the species boundary as a discontinuity — and no such reason has been established.",
    "While the mammalian evidence is most developed, anxiety-like states are not confined to mammals. Zebrafish display robust anxiety responses in novel tank tests — diving to the bottom, reducing exploration, increasing erratic movement — that are sensitive to anxiolytic drugs (Egan et al., 2009). Crayfish exposed to repeated stress fields show increased avoidance behavior that is reversed by benzodiazepine administration, prompting Fossat et al. (2014) to describe this as evidence for anxiety-like states in invertebrates. If even invertebrates exhibit pharmacologically modifiable states that functionally parallel anxiety, the argument that emotion-linked cognition is unique to humans becomes increasingly difficult to maintain.",
    "These findings do not require us to claim that a crayfish has rich subjective experience or that its inner life resembles ours. The argument is functional: anxiety, wherever it appears, involves the kind of anticipatory, evaluative processing that constitutes thought. The degree of cognitive sophistication may vary enormously across species, but the presence of some form of thought — internal processing that goes beyond reflexive stimulus-response — is indicated by the very structure of anxiety as a psychological phenomenon.",
    "Anxiety is not a simple alarm. It is a forward-looking, context-sensitive, evaluatively complex state that requires an organism to represent possible futures, assess uncertainty, and adjust behavior accordingly. The neurobiological, pharmacological, and behavioral evidence demonstrates that nonhuman animals — from primates to rodents to fish — exhibit anxiety in precisely this sense. If an organism can worry about what has not yet happened, it is not merely reacting to the world; it is thinking about it. The capacity for anxiety is, in this respect, a window into animal minds — evidence that thought is not a uniquely human achievement but a widespread biological strategy for navigating an uncertain world."
