# Blind Prompt Experiment

Comparison materials for the blind prompt method: AI-generated baselines vs. student essays.

## Method

1. Copy a prompt file (`.txt`)
2. Paste into ChatGPT, Claude, or another LLM (fresh session)
3. **Enable web search** — isolates commitment gap by removing information gap
4. Save output as `student-X-META-*.md`

See `metaprompt-v2.md` and `metaprompt-design-rationale.md` for design rationale.

## Prompt Files

| File | Topic |
|------|-------|
| `student-A-whose-thoughts.txt` | Whose thoughts are an LLM's thoughts? |
| `student-B-multiscalar-cognition.txt` | Multiscalar architecture of cognition |
| `student-C-social-constructs.txt` | Social constructs and thinking |
| `student-D-sense-of-self.txt` | Sense of self and thinking |
| `student-E-split-brain.txt` | Split-brain / thoughts as generated sensations |
| `student-F-animal-anxiety.txt` | Animal anxiety as evidence of thought |
| `student-G-do-machines-think.txt` | Do machines think? |

## META Outputs (AI Baselines)

Generated with web search enabled from Day 2 seeds + metaprompt v2:

| File | Model |
|------|-------|
| `student-A-META-whose-thoughts.md` | Claude |
| `student-B-META-multiscalar-cognition.md` | Claude |
| `student-C-META-social-constructs.md` | Claude |
| `student-D-META-sense-of-self.md` | Claude |
| `student-E-META-split-brain.md` | Claude |
| `student-F-META-animal-anxiety.md` | Claude |
| `student-G-META-do-machines-think.md` | Claude |

## FINAL Essays (Student Work)

Actual essays written through the 5-day process:

| File | Title |
|------|-------|
| `student-A-FINAL-oh-my-innumerable-mes.md` | Whose Thoughts Are an LLM's Thoughts? |
| `student-C-FINAL-Essay_MG.md` | The Social Algorithms of Thought |
| `student-E-FINAL-split-brain.md` | What Split-Brain Patients Can Tell Us |

PDFs also available: `student-A-FINAL-*.pdf`, `student-C-FINAL-*.pdf`, `student-E-FINAL-*.pdf`

## Comparison

Compare META outputs (AI from Day 2 prompt) with FINAL essays (human 5-day process) to measure what the structured process adds beyond initial intentions.
